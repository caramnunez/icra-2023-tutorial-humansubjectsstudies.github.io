title: About this tutorial
---

To effectively make robots for humans, it is necessary to incorporate various human-subjects experiments - study of human-robot interactions, human utilization and learning, and human feedback and impressions. However, the key experiment designs and analyses of human subjects testing are often absent in training in prominent departments of roboticists, such as computer science, mechanical engineering, or electrical engineering, leaving many of these topics to self-study.

This tutorial is to bridge this gap by providing:
- an overview and framework of human subjects experiments
- an archive of quality resources for further learning and reference for novice roboticists

The desired outcomes of this tutorial are to:
- connect the next generation of roboticists with peers and prominent researchers in their field who are also working in human-subjects sub-fields
- provide active practice in experiment design
- provide tools for further study and reference

## Tutorial Format ##
Our proposed format consists of two sessions. 

**Session 1: Presentations on the Fundamentals of Human Subjects Experiment Design**

The first session is a series of presentations by invited speakers on key topics such as:
- experiment design
- statistical tests
- effective surveys for qualitative feedback
- common analyses and metrics

The aim of the first session is to provide the background necessary to be able to understand the basics of conducting human subjects studies and the steps to take to design and run human subject studies. Specifically, we aim to answer the questions:
- Where do I start?
- What are the terms that researchers and reviewers use?
- How does these terms relate to my study design?
- Where can I go to learn more?

**Session 2: Workshopping Experiment Designs**

The second part will be an experimental design workshop. Participants will be encouraged to:
- submit a planned experiment design prior to the tutorial for review
- take part in small groups led by a SME during the tutorial where they will continue to workshop and get feedback on their experiment design and proposed analysis with the SME and peers

Participant experiment plans will be reviewed by at least 3 subject matter experts (SMEs), receiving  written feedback prior to attending the tutorial. 

## Virtual and Asynchronous Participation ##

Presentations in the first session will be live-streamed via Zoom and recorded and posted to the website to allow roboticists who may be unable to travel to the conference to participate and learn from the presentations. Questions for the Q&A panels can be submitted during the live tutorial via an online form available on the [home](../index) page.

In the second session, in addition to in-person discussion groups around tables, virtual discussion will be formed via Zoom break-out rooms. To assist in asynchronous participation, participants who submitted experiment plans can opt to allow us to provide anonymous, annotated experiment plans for reference for those unable to submit a experiment plan for the tutorial.
