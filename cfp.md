title: Call for Contributions
---

In addition to the invited talks listed on the [program schedule](../schedule), we are looking for particiaption in two capactities:
- we solicit whitepaper contributions from roboticists that are novices to human subjects testing for review from three subject matter experts prior to the tutorial and to take part in small groups workshopping based on feedback during the second half of the tutprial.
- we are looking for subject matter experts to volunteer to review participant experiment plans prior to the conference as well as contribute to small group dicussions in Session 2 of the event, providing experiment plan feedback as well as be a resource for deeper discussion on the tutprial topics based on your own experience. 
- for subject matter experts unable to contribute to experiment plan reviews or attend the tutorial, we value your feedback through [our survey](https://forms.gle/HoaSrVq8DRVDhEL37) on topics and resources useful to train novices, as well as to provide your experience of human subjects testing within the robotics community. 

We hope to attract contributions from a wide range of engineering, computer science, psychology, physical therapy, and other related fields, so if you work in this space, don't hesitate to submit directly or [reach out](../contact) with any questions.

## Submission Link

Experiment Plans (alongside attestations of planned conference travel to enable us to plan hybrid logistics) should be submitted via [this form](https://forms.gle/D2C1Csum6EBhA1xeA).

We are always open to more subject matter experts that can act as reviewers prior to and at the event as well as provide reference resources for our reference page. Please notify us if you would like to contribute to this tutorial by filling out [our survey](https://forms.gle/HoaSrVq8DRVDhEL37).

## Deadlines

Experiment Plan contributions will be accepted on a **rolling basis** until **February 28, 2023**. To enable potential contributors to plan travel to and registration for the ICRA 2023 conference, we guarantee responses by **March 31, 2023**.

Reviewer volunteers will be accepted on a **rolling basis** until **February 28, 2023**.

## FAQ

### Who should submit?

Broadly, we solicit contributions from novices to human-subjects testing. We welcome contributions from anyone working in this space, in academia, industry, or medicine, and at any stage in their career (undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, faculty, clinical practitioner, or prospective user).

The primary objectives of this workshop is to **provide an overview of key topics in human subjects testing and provide expert reviews and real-time practice developing experiment plans**. Since these discussions are most effective early in the research process, **we encourage submission of any-stage work (and ESPECIALLY early-stage work)** addressing this objective.

**Work that has already been published in other venues is explicitly welcome**, as long as it addresses the goals of the workshop; submissions will not be indexed on IEEE Xplore. Contributors will, however, be given the option of archiving their work on the workshop website as annotated examples for asynchronous participants.

### What is the appropriate submission format?

Because our primary objective is to facilitate discussion of experiment designs between between novices to human-subjects testing peers and subject matter experts, whitepaper submissions of any format and length are welcome.

While we do not require them, contributors should feel free to use the [IEEE templates](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). We recommend, but again do not require, a length of approximately 2+n pages (2 pages of content + unlimited references).

If you expect to deviate substantially from these recommendations and are concerned, feel free to [reach out to us](../contact). For those looking for more guidance, several example submission formats are available below.

### Can I get more guidance on appropriate submission structure?

**We do not require a specific whitepaper structure.** For those looking for more guidance, however, here is an example outline:

**Outline: Experiment Plan** 
1. Problem/Need Definition
2. Existing Solutions (if any)
3. Possible Novel Solutions
4. Experimental Methods
5. Data Analysis
6. Results (if any)

### What will be the workshop format?

Those with accepted experiment designs will be put into small groups either around tables or in Zoom break-out rooms to discuss their feedback and collaborate with peers and subject matter experts, as outlined in the [program schedule](../schedule):

Exact details on presentation logistics, including in-person and remote presentation options, will be available soon.
